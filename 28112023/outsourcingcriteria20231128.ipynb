    "Subject: criteria for outsourcing cases \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Dear Nil, Tomasz\n",
    "I would like to ask the Risk team opinion on the criteria for outsourcing cases to External Collection Agencies ECA. \n",
    "As per my experience - Risk team should be the decision maker on the criteria (if you don’t mind).\n",
    " \n",
    "My initial thoughts are the following:\n",
    "Segment A  - “Fresh risky & non-contacting clients”. The goal – is quick outsourcing with potential field visit in order to normalize client within B1. OR, to confirm the fraud after field visit. It could be weekly allocations to ECA.\n",
    "•         DPD 20+, \n",
    "•         no contact with client after the loan disbursement date (neither WCL, nor Reminder, nor Soft collection stage, nor CC chats/calls). This means fully lost client from a contact perspective.\n",
    "•         Collection team made/tried more than 10 attempt-day (it would be roughly 25-35+ call attempts) to establish the contact in the current delinquency cycle (dpd 1 to 20)\n",
    "•         Products – all QL and SIL\n",
    "•         FPD or SPD clients only\n",
    "•         No partial payments for the last scheduled EMI\n",
    " \n",
    "Segment B: “Mid-range stage”. It could be monthly allocations to ECA.\n",
    "•         DPD 60+\n",
    "•         No PTPs from the client in the current delinquency cycle (DPD 1-60)\n",
    "•         No partial payments for the last scheduled EMI\n",
    "•         There is no contact with client for the last 30 day, OR, there are only Refuse to pay disposition codes.\n",
    " \n",
    "Segment C: 90+\n",
    "•         DPD 90+ \n",
    "•         without kPTPs for the last 60 days\n",
    "•         without payments for the last 60 days\n",
    " \n",
    "This is just suggestion. \n",
    "Please let me know the final Rules the Collection team should follow/execute.\n",
    "It would be great to receive your inputs by Monday 22-Nov, EOD.\n",
    " \n",
    "Thanks in advance!\n",
